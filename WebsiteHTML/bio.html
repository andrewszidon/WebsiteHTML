I'm Andrew Szidon. I am currently a freshman at Georgia Tech, and I plan on majoring in CS in Intelligence-Theory threads, and minoring in Math.
<br>I've long believed that AI have the potential to revolutionize every aspect of human life. Outside of academics, I plan on getting higher dan in Karate, and at least a 1st dan in Hapkido.
<br>In addition to college courses and some experience I have had with developing for Andriod during my 12th year.
<br>I've achieved the rank of Eagle Scout and of 1st dan in Karate, both of which required putting me in positions of leadership, and guiding and teaching others.
